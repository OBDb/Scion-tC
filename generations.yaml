    description: "The first-generation Scion tC was introduced as a compact sport coupe aimed at younger buyers, embodying Scion's mission to attract a new generation to the Toyota brand. Based on the European Toyota Avensis platform, the tC featured a sleek two-door hatchback design with a standard panoramic glass moonroof, giving it a premium feel unusual for its price point. Powered by a 2.4-liter inline-four engine producing 160 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, the tC offered respectable performance for an entry-level coupe, with power delivered to the front wheels through either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The interior was designed to appeal to younger buyers with premium-for-its-class materials, a driver-oriented cockpit, and a 160-watt Pioneer audio system with customization options. A key aspect of the tC's appeal was its extensive customization potential, with Scion offering numerous dealer-installed accessories and a thriving aftermarket. The tC also featured surprising practicality for a sport coupe with 60/40 split folding rear seats that reclined up to 45 degrees and generous cargo capacity through the hatchback design. Safety features included standard front, side, and curtain airbags—comprehensive for its time and class. Throughout its production run, the first-generation tC received minimal changes beyond special edition 'Release Series' versions offering unique colors, wheels, and accessories. The tC quickly became Scion's best-selling model, successfully connecting with its target demographic of young, style-conscious buyers looking for an affordable yet personalized vehicle."

    description: "The second-generation Scion tC debuted with a more angular and aggressive design than its predecessor, featuring a thicker, flat-bottomed steering wheel, more bolstered seats, and an overall more muscular stance. Built on a revised platform shared with various Toyota models, the new tC grew slightly in dimensions while maintaining its coupe-hatchback body style with panoramic moonroof. Power came from an updated 2.5-liter inline-four engine producing 180 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque—a significant increase over the previous generation—paired with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The interior received a substantial upgrade with better materials, a more premium-feeling flat-bottomed steering wheel inspired by the Lexus LFA supercar, and an eight-speaker 300-watt Pioneer audio system with standard Bluetooth connectivity and HD radio. The tC maintained its practical nature with 60/40 split folding rear seats and good cargo capacity for a sport coupe. A minor refresh in 2014 brought updated headlights, a revised front grille, new 18-inch alloy wheels, and an upgraded standard audio system with 6.1-inch touchscreen display. As with the previous generation, Scion offered regular 'Release Series' special editions with unique colors, wheels, and accessories, maintaining the brand's focus on personalization. The second-generation tC continued as Scion's volume seller until the brand's discontinuation after the 2016 model year, appealing to buyers seeking an affordable sporty coupe with practical features and personalization options. Unlike some other Scion models that transitioned to the Toyota brand, the tC was discontinued entirely when Scion was absorbed back into Toyota."
