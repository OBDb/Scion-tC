    description: "The first-generation Scion tC was introduced as a compact sport coupe aimed at younger buyers, embodying Scion's mission to attract a new generation to the Toyota brand. Based on the European Toyota Avensis platform, the tC featured a sleek two-door hatchback design with a standard panoramic glass moonroof, giving it a premium feel unusual for its price point. Toyota debuted the production tC at the January 2004 North American International Auto Show with sales beginning in May 2004 as a 2005 model year. Powered by a 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE inline-four engine producing 160 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, the tC offered respectable performance for an entry-level coupe, with power delivered to the front wheels through either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The interior was designed to appeal to younger buyers with premium-for-its-class materials, a driver-oriented cockpit, and a 160-watt Pioneer audio system with CD player. A key aspect of the tC's appeal was its extensive customization potential, with Scion offering numerous dealer-installed accessories and a thriving aftermarket. The tC also featured surprising practicality for a sport coupe with 60/40 split folding rear seats that reclined up to 45 degrees and generous cargo capacity through the hatchback design. Safety features included standard front, side, and curtain airbags—comprehensive for its time and class. The tC quickly became Scion's best-selling model, with 79,125 units sold in 2006."

    description: "The first-generation Scion tC received a minor refresh in 2007 for the 2008 model year that included a revised grille and new 'Altezza'-styled head and taillights. The 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE engine received updated tuning for the 2007 model year, increasing power slightly. Safety features were enhanced for 2008 models with the addition of front seat-mounted side torso airbags, front and rear side curtain airbags, and a driver's knee airbag becoming standard. The Spec Package option was discontinued after the 2008 model year, leaving only the fully-equipped trim. Scion continued to offer 'Release Series' special editions throughout this period, including RS 4.0 (2008) in Galactic Gray Mica, RS 5.0 (2009) in Gloss Black, and RS 6.0 (2010) in Speedway Blue. Sales declined significantly by the end of this generation, dropping to 15,204 units in 2010."

    description: "The second-generation Scion tC debuted with a more angular and aggressive design than its predecessor, featuring a thicker, flat-bottomed steering wheel inspired by the Lexus LFA supercar, more bolstered seats, and an overall more muscular stance. The replacement model debuted at the April 2010 New York International Auto Show and appeared in U.S. dealerships in October 2010. Built on a revised Toyota New MC platform shared with the Avensis, the new tC grew slightly in dimensions while maintaining its coupe-hatchback body style with panoramic moonroof. Power came from an updated 2.5-liter 2AR-FE inline-four engine producing 180 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque—a significant increase over the previous generation—paired with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The interior received a substantial upgrade with better materials, an 8-speaker 300-watt Pioneer audio system with standard Bluetooth connectivity and HD radio. The tC maintained its practical nature with 60/40 split folding rear seats and good cargo capacity for a sport coupe. Scion offered 'Release Series' special editions including RS 7.0 (2012) in High Voltage Yellow and RS 8.0 (2013) in Absolutely Red."

    description: "The second-generation Scion tC received a significant facelift for the 2014 model year, coinciding with the launch of the Scion FR-S. Inspired by the FR-S design language, the 2014 tC received updated headlamps, grille, LED taillights, 18-inch alloy rims, body kit, sport-tuned suspension, reworked faster shifting transmission, sport-tuned shocks, and a new 6.1-inch touchscreen audio system. Scion offered a Series 10 anniversary edition for the first model year, limited to 3,500 units, featuring silver color, silver seat belts, a solar-powered illuminated shift knob, and sequentially numbered interior badge. For the 2016 model year, minor changes included a standard rear windshield wiper, silver interior door handles, center console tray cover, and leather-wrapped shift knob. The tC ended production in August 2016 after a final Release Series 10.0 edition in Barcelona Red with 1,200 units produced, as part of the phasing out of the Scion brand. The tC was Scion's best-selling model, constituting almost 40% of total Scion sales."
